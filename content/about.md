Hey Everyone! 

The Name is James Strong and I love the cloud and teaching people about it. I'm from louisville, KY, it's ["Loo-a-vul" or "Loo-ee-ville" and never Loo-is-ville](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8Bn9o_L08o) 
I am extremely passionate about Cloud Native tech, containers and Infrastructure. I enjoy talking to CTO's, 
junior engineers and colleagues about cloud technologies. I am a big supporter of Code Louisville and 
local Louisville Tech meetups, I also run [Louisville Kubernetes and Cloud native Computing meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Kubernetes-and-Cloud-Native-Computing-Louisville/) 

If you're interested in what I have done, checkout my [posts](/post), or [resume](/resume).

Thanks for reading, hopefully you find something helpful here!
