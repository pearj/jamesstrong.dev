I've spent the last year created a course for A Cloud Guru. With 3.4 hours of content and 36 lessons, I look forward 
to your feedback. Here is my "Advanced Networking with Kubernetes on AWS" Course. 

Since its release in 2014, Kubernetes has become the de-facto standard for container orchestration. Kubernetes is a distributed system for managing containers and its networking is no different. Many companies are deploying Kubernetes on-prem and in the cloud, both managed offerings and self-deployed. With that, the demand for System, Network and Cluster Administrators to understand the underpinnings of the network stack in Kubernetes is ever-increasing.

This course is a deep dive into the Kubernetes network model, the components involved and how to deploy, manage and troubleshoot the cluster network.

Prior knowledge of Networking, Containers and Kubernetes API objects is required.
