This talk was presented in 2017 at Louisville Local Software Development Conference Codepalousa.

In this presentation I discussed DevOps, how Continuous Integration and Deployment integrates into that, and 
how CI/CD can be implemented with AWS services.


| Running Rules for CI/CD                       |   AWS Tool  |
|:-----------------------------------------------|:-------------:|
| 1. Maintain a code repository                 |   Commit    |
| 2. Automate the build                         |   *         |
| 3. Keep the build fast                        |   Build     |
| 4. Make the build self-testing                |   Deploy    |
| 5. Commit early, commit often                 |   Commit    |
| 6. Every commit to the mainline gets built    |   Pipeline  |
| 7. Everyone can see the results of the build  |   Pipeline  |
| 8. Automate the deployment and rollback       |   Deploy    |
