This past year [Vallery Lancey](https://twitter.com/vllry) and I have been working on a Kubernetes Networking Book. 

I am proud to announce that we have an early release of Chapters 1-3 of the book available on O'Reilly Digital 
platform. 

Kubernetes Networking is an essential guide for anyone who wants to deploy, manage, or troubleshoot a production-scale Kubernetes network.

Understanding Kubernetes clusters isn't enough to operate Kubernetes at scale. Every layer of the stack--the network, operating system, and Kubernetes--depends on the layer below. Successful administrators need to understand each layer and how it works across deployments on-premises, in the cloud, and with managed services. Kubernetes Networking clearly guides administrators through the layers of complexity and abstraction that come with running a Kubernetes network. It covers:

* The Kubernetes networking model
* The CNCF Container Network Interface Project and how to choose the best interface for your clusters
* The networking and Linux primitives that power Kubernetes
* How to quickly troubleshoot networking issues and prevent downtime
* Cloud networking and Kubernetes with the three major providers: AWS, GCP, and Azure
* The pros and cons of various network tools--and how to select the best ones for your stack
