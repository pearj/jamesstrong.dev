      <description>Another year, another re:Invent down! 2018 had everything we have come to expect from AWS and re:Invent - releases, updates, sessions on everything and shots at Oracle. The focus this time was certainly on developer experience, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning and Serverless.
There were at least sixteen new releases in regards to ML/AI. Sagemaker got new features in Ground truth and RL. There is now a marketplace for machine learning algorithm writers to release them and earn from all their hard work.</description>
