      <description>At Dev Nexus 2018 my worker at Contino, Adarsh, and I led a workshop &amp;ldquo;Introduction to Kubernetes&amp;rdquo;
Introduction to Kubernetes is a hands-on, interactive workshop giving attendees a thorough understanding of the fundamentals of Kubernetes. As part of this workshop, you will learn how Kubernetes works, be able to successfully create a kubernetes cluster, deploy microservices to that cluster &amp;amp; also hear about some war stories.
