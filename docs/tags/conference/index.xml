      <description>Another year! Another amazing Code PaLOUsa come and gone.
Location This year Code PaLOUsa was at the Hyatt Regency, which is smack dap in the middle of downtown. This location makes it a perfect spot for all the speakers and conference-goers to experience some of the tourist spots in Louisville and still enjoy the conference.
Sessions The sessions were action-packed, as well. A (useful?) attribute of a conference is the level of difficulty for goers to decide which speakers to see!</description>

      <description>At Dev Nexus 2018 my co-worker, Adarsh, and I led a workshop &amp;ldquo;Introduction to Kubernetes&amp;rdquo;
Introduction to Kubernetes is a hands-on, interactive workshop giving attendees a thorough understanding of the fundamentals of Kubernetes. As part of this workshop, you will learn how Kubernetes works, be able to successfully create a kubernetes cluster, deploy microservices to that cluster &amp;amp; also hear about some war stories.

      <description>Before we dive into some of the highlights from DockerCon 2017, let’s do a quick overview of what Docker is. Quite simply, a “docker container” is a portable container, of sorts, that allows a collection of apps to run on any operating system.
How is it possible, you ask, for a docker container to allow any app to “Build, Ship and Run,” as the docker motto says, on any OS? A docker container uses kernel features to produce resource isolation (CPU, memory, block I/O and more) as well as separate namespaces, to isolate the application’s view of the operating system (a visual depiction below).</description>
