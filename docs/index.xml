      <description>Another year! Another amazing Code PaLOUsa come and gone.
Location This year Code PaLOUsa was at the Hyatt Regency, which is smack dap in the middle of downtown. This location makes it a perfect spot for all the speakers and conference-goers to experience some of the tourist spots in Louisville and still enjoy the conference.
Sessions The sessions were action-packed, as well. A (useful?) attribute of a conference is the level of difficulty for goers to decide which speakers to see!</description>

      <title>High-Performance Computing for Financial Services</title>

      <description>The last week of July, I attended High-Performance Compute (HPC) Training for Financial Services in AWS. During this week-long training, AWS professionals in Financial Services shared their outlook on the needs that large financial institutions face from the industry, regulators, and markets.
The first thing that caught my attention was this question:
&amp;ldquo;If you could add 100,000 cores to your HPC grid, return them once you&#39;re done and pay only for what you use, just like many of your peers do, how would that improve your business?</description>

      <description>At Dev Nexus 2018 my co-worker, Adarsh, and I led a workshop &amp;ldquo;Introduction to Kubernetes&amp;rdquo;
Introduction to Kubernetes is a hands-on, interactive workshop giving attendees a thorough understanding of the fundamentals of Kubernetes. As part of this workshop, you will learn how Kubernetes works, be able to successfully create a kubernetes cluster, deploy microservices to that cluster &amp;amp; also hear about some war stories.

      <description>On December 29th I completed my final goal of the year - I passed the CKA.
TL;DR This is a list of the bare minimum necessary to try to pass.
 Do Kelsey Hightower’s tutorial Kubernetes The Hard Way at least three times! Understand it, internalize it. Do all the tasks on https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/ Read Kubernetes in Action by Marko Luksa  Also practice, practice, and practice. Did I mention practice? This is a practical exam, no multiple choice questions here.</description>

      <description>Another year, another re:Invent down! 2018 had everything we have come to expect from AWS and re:Invent - releases, updates, sessions on everything and shots at Oracle. The focus this time was certainly on developer experience, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning and Serverless.
There were at least sixteen new releases in regards to ML/AI. Sagemaker got new features in Ground truth and RL. There is now a marketplace for machine learning algorithm writers to release them and earn from all their hard work.</description>

      <title>Dockercon 2017</title>

      <guid>https://jamesstrong.dev/post/2017/dockercon-2017/</guid>
      <description>Before we dive into some of the highlights from DockerCon 2017, let’s do a quick overview of what Docker is. Quite simply, a “docker container” is a portable container, of sorts, that allows a collection of apps to run on any operating system.
How is it possible, you ask, for a docker container to allow any app to “Build, Ship and Run,” as the docker motto says, on any OS? A docker container uses kernel features to produce resource isolation (CPU, memory, block I/O and more) as well as separate namespaces, to isolate the application’s view of the operating system (a visual depiction below).</description>

      <description>This talk was presented in 2017 at Louisville Local Software Development Conference Codepalousa.
In this presentation I discussed DevOps, how Continuous Integration and Deployment integrates into that, and how CI/CD can be implemented with AWS services.
   Running Rules for CI/CD AWS Tool     1. Maintain a code repository Commit   2. Automate the build *   3. Keep the build fast Build   4.</description>
