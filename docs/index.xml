      <description>At Dev Nexus 2018 my co-worker, Adarsh, and I led a workshop &amp;ldquo;Introduction to Kubernetes&amp;rdquo;
Introduction to Kubernetes is a hands-on, interactive workshop giving attendees a thorough understanding of the fundamentals of Kubernetes. As part of this workshop, you will learn how Kubernetes works, be able to successfully create a kubernetes cluster, deploy microservices to that cluster &amp;amp; also hear about some war stories.

      <description>On December 29th I completed my final goal of the year - I passed the CKA.
TL;DR This is a list of the bare minimum necessary to try to pass.
 Do Kelsey Hightower’s tutorial Kubernetes The Hard Way at least three times! Understand it, internalize it. Do all the tasks on https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/ Read Kubernetes in Action by Marko Luksa  Also practice, practice, and practice. Did I mention practice?</description>

      <description>Another year, another re:Invent down! 2018 had everything we have come to expect from AWS and re:Invent - releases, updates, sessions on everything and shots at Oracle. The focus this time was certainly on developer experience, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning and Serverless.
There were at least sixteen new releases in regards to ML/AI. Sagemaker got new features in Ground truth and RL. There is now a marketplace for machine learning algorithm writers to release them and earn from all their hard work.</description>
